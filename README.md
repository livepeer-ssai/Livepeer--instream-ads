The aim of this tutorial is to provide a guide on how to implement in-stream ads in Livepeer player using Interactive media ads(IMA) sdk. This tutorial example is a simple or basic version of the Livepeer player with IMA sdk.


*Note - with the expose primitives you can build the complete version of the player*

We also built a plugin for you to wrap your Player if you dont want to implement this from scratch .[Livepeerjs-ima](https://github.com/livepeer-ssai/IMA-Adwrapper-Livepeer)
